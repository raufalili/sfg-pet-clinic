# sfg-pet-clinic
SFT Pet Clinic. I have done this project during "Spring Framework 5: Beginner to guru" course. 

This is real world Spring Boot project built using Maven.

I started this project from scratch and followed all the steps to create it. 
During developing the application I learned a lot about Spring Framework.

I learned how to use JPA data modeling with Spring and Hibernate, 
testing Spring MVC using JUnit, and using Project Lombok to make life easier.
I also learned how to apply CRUD operations with Spring MVC and working wiht validation and constraints
